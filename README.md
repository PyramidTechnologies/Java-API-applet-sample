Java API Applet Example
=========

Sample application utilizing the Pyramid Java API for Pyramid bill validators. With this API
you can quickly configure your application to operate with a bill validator. This application shows RS-232 state transition and reports the denomination of accepted notes. It also demonstrates an application were you may sell access to service for a period of time. Time is added by inserting more money into the bill validator. 
  

## Requirements

1. A supported bill validator
   - Apex 7000
   - Apex 5000
   - Trilogy *requires RS-232 firmware*
   - Curve *require RS-232 firmware*
2. Communication Harness
   - [Recommended Harness](http://shop.pyramidacceptors.com/usb-rs-232-communication-cable-harness-for-apex-05aa0023/)
   - Or a DB9 RS-232 connection or USB UART cable of your choice
3. Your favorite Java editor (we use Netbeans because projects are easy to share)
4. A copy of [PTalk.jar](http://developers.pyramidacceptors.com/api/release/PTalk.jar)

## Setup
If you are using Netbeans, simply open the project and satisfy the PTalk.jar dependency. You will then be able to run and debug the application. Step 3, profit.
